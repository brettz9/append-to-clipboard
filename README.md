# append-to-clipboard

A restartless
[Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/append-to-clipboard/)
to allow appending to the clipboard, optionally with a single or double
line break in between.

Note that if the clipboard begins with formatted HTML and you paste the
contents into a text-only environment, the line breaks will be converted
into spaces. To avoid this, consider using
[Copy Plain Text 2](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-plain-text-2/)
when first copying content.

1. As per [this comment](https://ask.mozilla.org/question/443/preserving-line-breaks-when-pasting-formatted-clipboard-to-unformatted/)
I might try avoiding the SDK and supporting additional flavors.
